# stationary-shop
 
I have designed a project on a stationary shop where I have implemented php for dynamic response of the website and I have organized website by html and designed it visually attractive by css and java script, it has categories such as paper stationery, office stationery, art stationery and writing stationery, besides that I have also designed an admin page where admin can add and delete a category, add and delete a product edit and view the orders. All these are accomplished using my sql database and php admin, It also has basic requirements such as a login page, a billing page, user cart.


Welcome to the **Stationery Shop**, a basic and responsive webshop made with PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, and a dash of JavaScript. It is meant to allow users to browse, search for, and purchase stationery products comfortably while providing admins total control over product and order management.
